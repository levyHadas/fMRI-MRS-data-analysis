Python script designed to organize, combine and analyze MRS exams data. 

MRS exams are a clinic metabolic exams using MRI.
The institute had a lot of research exams data the was not organized and therefore could not be used for visualization of farther research.
The purpose of this project was to organize the data and visualize it's analysis. 
The analysis parameters were given by the researchers in the field. 

In addition, there was a need for a GUI so the future exams will be organized automatically. Some data had to be inserted manually,
therefore the GUI includes input options.
